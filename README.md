# Node.js Package Builder

Node.js Package Builder is a CLI tool that automates the creation of Node.js packages, preparing them for npm publishing. It streamlines the process of setting up a new package by generating a `package.json` file, a main file (`index.js`), and any additional script files as needed. It also sets up a basic README.md and LICENSE file.

## Features

- Interactive CLI for easy package setup
- Generates a formatted `package.json` file with provided details
- Creates a basic `index.js` file and additional script files
- Sets up a README.md and LICENSE file for your package
- Ready for npm publishing with minimal setup

## Installation

To install Node.js Package Builder, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Once you have those, run the following command:

```sh
npm install -g nodejs-package-builder
```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the package builder using the following command:

```sh
nodejs-package-builder
```

The CLI will prompt you to enter the necessary details for your package, such as:

- Package Name
- Version
- Description
- Main File
- Scripts
- Keywords
- Author
- License

Once all the information is provided, the tool will generate the files in the appropriate structure.
